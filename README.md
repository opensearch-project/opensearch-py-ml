## Welcome!

**opensearch-py-ml** is a Python client that provides a suite of data analytics and machine learning tools for OpenSearch.

It is [a community-driven, open source fork](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-opensearch/) a fork of [eland](https://github.com/elastic/eland), which provides data analysis and machine learning
licensed under the [Apache v2.0 License](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py/blob/main/LICENSE.txt). 

**opensearch-py-ml** lets users call OpenSearch indices and manipulate them as if they were pandas DataFrames, supporting
complex filtering and aggregation operations. It also provides rudimentary support for uploading models to OpenSearch
clusters using the [ml-commons](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ml-commons) plugin.
