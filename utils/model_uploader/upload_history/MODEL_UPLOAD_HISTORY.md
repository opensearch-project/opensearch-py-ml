# Pretrained Model Upload History

The model-serving framework supports a variety of open-source pretrained models that can assist with a range of machine learning (ML) search and analytics use cases. 


## Uploaded Pretrained Models


### Sentence transformers

Sentence transformer models map sentences and paragraphs across a dimensional dense vector space. The number of vectors depends on the model. Use these models for use cases such as clustering and semantic search. 

The following table shows sentence transformer model upload history.
