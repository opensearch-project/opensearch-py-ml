    "# Demo Notebook for Sentence Transformer Model Training, Saving and Uploading to OpenSearch\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the technique of synthetic data generation and how it can be used to obtain a deep learning model for Search that is custom built for a given set of documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models are very powerful and have been shown to improve state of the art in several disciplines and tasks. However, they need a lot of labelled training data. Such data is often hard to obtain.  In this notebook, we show how pre-trained large language models can be used to circumvent this issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on the task of passage retrieval i.e the corpus consists of passages which is searched at run-time given a user query. This search can be performed by transformers such as BERT as long as BERT is trained on a labelled dataset that consists of pairs such as (queries, relevant passage). Such a BERT model can be used for semantic search. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synthetic query generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of such labelled data we provide a synthetic query generator (SQG) model that can be used to create synthetic queries given a passage. The SQG model is a large transformer model that has been trained to generate human like queries given a passage. Thus it can be used to create a labelled dataset of (synthetic queries, passage). A BERT model can be trained on this synthetic data and used for semantic search. In fact, we have shown that such synthetically trained models beat the current state-of-the-art models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train BERT Model with synthetic query data\n",
    "\n",
    "After generating synthetic query we can train Sentence Transformer model to get more precise embedding. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a walkthrough guidance for users use their synthetic queries to fine tune and train a sentence transformer model. In this notebook, you use opensearch_py_ml to accomplish the following:\n",

Albumin is a protein present in the blood. Proteins are normally absent in urine because the kidney cells generally prevent large molecules including proteins, from being excreted. Some proteins may appear in the urine in normal individuals also if blood levels are very high. In kidney diseases, albumin will appear in the urine even with normal blood levels.\n",

The Tides Wharf & Restaurant, in which the assorted locals shelter from the bird attacks, has expanded into an unrecognisable hotel complex since the film was made.

Urinalysis is used to detect and assess a wide range of disorders, such as urinary tract infection, kidney disease and diabetes. Urinalysis involves examining the appearance, concentration and content of urine. Abnormal urinalysis results may point to a disease or illness. For example, a urinary tract infection can make urine look cloudy instead of clear. Increased levels of protein in urine can be a sign of kidney disease.\n",

    "After generated a model zip file, the users will need to describe model configuration in a ml-commons_model_config.json file. The `make_model_config_json` function in sentencetransformermodel class will parse the config file from hugging-face config.son file. If users would like to use a different config than the pre-trained sentence transformer, `make_model_config_json` function provide arguuments to change the configuration content and generated a ml-commons_model_config.json file. Plese visit the [SentenceTransformerModel.make_model_config_json](https://opensearch-project.github.io/opensearch-py-ml/reference/api/sentence_transformer.html#opensearch_py_ml.sentence_transformer_model.SentenceTransformerModel.make_model_config_json) for API Reference . \n",

With a zip file contains model in  Torch Script format, and a configuration file for tokenizers in json format, the `upload_model` function connects to opensearch through ml client and upload the model.
