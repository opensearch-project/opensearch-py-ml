    "#### [download notebook](https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-py-ml/blob/main/docs/source/examples/demo_transformer_model_train_save_upload_to_openSearch.ipynb)\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces the technique of synthetic data generation and how it can be used to obtain a deep learning model for Search that is custom built for a given set of documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning models are very powerful and have been shown to improve state of the art in several disciplines and tasks. However, they need a lot of labelled training data. Such data is often hard to obtain.  In this notebook, we show how pre-trained large language models can be used to circumvent this issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "We focus on the task of passage retrieval i.e the corpus consists of passages which is searched at run-time given a user query. This search can be performed by transformers such as BERT as long as BERT is trained on a labelled dataset that consists of pairs such as (queries, relevant passage). Such a BERT model can be used for semantic search. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synthetic query generation\n",
    "\n",
    "In the absence of such labelled data we provide a synthetic query generator (SQG) model that can be used to create synthetic queries given a passage. The SQG model is a large transformer model that has been trained to generate human like queries given a passage. Thus it can be used to create a labelled dataset of (synthetic queries, passage). A BERT model can be trained on this synthetic data and used for semantic search. In fact, we find that such synthetically trained models beat the current state-of-the-art models. Note that resulting BERT model is a customized model since it has been trained on a specific corpus (and corresponding synthetic queries).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an end-to-end guide for users to generate synthetic queries and fine-tune a sentence transformer model on it using opensearch_py_ml. It consists of the following steps,\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Import packages and set up client\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Import the data/passages for synthetic query generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Generate Synthetic Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Read synthetic queries and train/fine-tune model using a hugging face sentence transformer model\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5: Upload the model to OpenSearch cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 3 and 4 are computed intensive step, and we recommend running it on a machine with 4 or more GPUS such as the EC2 `p3.8xlarge` or `p3.16xlarge`."

    "\n",
    "    1) Convert the data into a form that can be consumed by the Synthetic query generator (SQG) model. This amounts to tokenizing the data using a tokenizer. The SQG model is a fine-tuned version of the GPT-XL model https://huggingface.co/gpt2-xl and the tokenizer is the GPT tokenizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2) The tokenizer has a max input length of 512 tokens. Every passage is tokenized with the special tokens <|startoftext|> and QRY: appended to the beginning and the end of every passage respectively. Note that tokenization is a time intensive process and the script saves the tokenized data after the first pass. We recommend setting tokenize_data = False subsequently. \n",
    "\n",
    "    3) Load the SQG model i.e. 1.5B parameter GPT2-XL model that has been trained to ask questions given passages. This model has been made publicly available and can be found here https://ci.opensearch.org/ci/dbc/models/ml-models/amazon/gpt/GPT2_xl_sqg/1.0.0/GPT2_xl_sqg.zip.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4) Once the model has been loaded and the data has been tokenized, the model starts the process of query generation. \"total_queries\" is number of synthetic queries generated for every passage and \"numseq\" is the number of queries that are generated by a model at a given time. Ideally total_queries = numseq, but this can lead to out of memory issues. So set numseq to an integer that is around 10 or less, and is a divisor of total_queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5) The script also requires to know the number of GPUs and the number of machines/nodes that it can use. Since we are using a single node instance with no GPUs we pass 0 and 1 to the function respectively. Our recommended setting is to use 1 machine/node with at least 4 (ideally 8) GPUs. \n",
    "\n",
    "    6) The script now begins to generate queries and displays a progress bar. We create total_queries per passage. Empirically we find that generating more queries leads to better performance but there are diminishing returns since the total inference time increases with total_queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7) After generating the queries, the function uses a publicly available package called Detoxify to remove inappropriate queries from the dataset. \"toxic_cutoff\" is a float. The script rejects all queries that have a toxicity score greater than toxic_cutoff\n",
